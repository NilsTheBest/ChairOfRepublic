 Right now, we limit our manager count to 50, but if you are active  in this studio, suggest QOTWs and other things, like thumbnails and general suggestions, in the SoC Extra studio, and become one with the chair, you may be promoted. Be aware, we will not promote you within a few weeks of you joining, nor will we promote you if you say "I wANnA BEcOme a mAnAGeR" or beg. It might take a while, so please be patient and don't ask.

Like a manager. Someone who was active since the very beginning or who's made notable changes to SoC.
