≈What is the CoR?
 The CoR is a fun place to hang 
out with your friends, eat all of 
our virtual cookies and talk about 
chairs and IKEA.

≈Can I join?
 Yes, just ask one of our 
managers to invite you, and wait a bit.

≈What is QoTW?
 The Question of the Week is a chair related question that is selected weekly. Suggest them in the CoR Extra Studio! (check links)

≈What is a chair?
Awesome 

≈What is a cookie? 
Delicious.

≈Why is the title changing so often?
No worries, it's normal. :P

≈How old is this studio?
This studio turned 2 on February 22nd, 2021! 

≈How can I become a master chair (manager)? 
 Right now, we limit our manager count to 50, but if you are active  in this studio, suggest QOTWs and other things, like thumbnails and general suggestions, in the CoR Extra studio, and become one with the chair, you may be promoted. Be aware, we will not promote you within a few weeks of you joining, nor will we promote you if you say "I wANnA BEcOme a mAnAGeR" or beg. It might take a while, so please be patient and don't ask.

≈What is a Notable Chair?
Like a manager. Someone who was active since the very beginning or who's made notable changes to CoR.
